This is project 3 from the Web Developer path on openclassrooms.

## Presentation ##

   - The task for this project is to create a platform where users can find a restaurant of their choice in the French capital and preorder the meal of their choice.

   - For now the website will not be fully "functional" as the aim here is to gain knowledge and experience with the visual aspect of a webpage.

   - Along with using basic HTML I have made the use of a CSS compiler (SASS) to help make the code more manageable.

   - With this project I have introduced some basic animation such as spinning, scaling and fade in with @keyframes.


## Project Expectations ##

### 1- Graphic Identity: ###

Fonts:
Logo and Titles: Shrikhand
Text: Roboto

Colors:
Primary #9356DC
Secondary #FF79DA
Tertiary #99E2D0
				

### 2 - Compatibility: ###

As the target market is the connected and hurried population, the site will be developed using the mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile models will be made.

On tablet and desktop, the site will have to adapt, but these formats are not a priority, so the developer defines the layout.

   - The whole site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.
    
   - The pages will have to pass WÂ£C validation on HTML and CSS without errors.
    
   - The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox and     Safari.
    

## DELIVERABLES: ##

### 1 - Page Content: ###

Homepage (x1):

   - Display the locatio of restaurants. Eventually, it will be possoble to choose restaurants close to a certain place.
   - A short presentation of the company.
   - A section containing the four menus on the form of maps. When clicking on the map, the user is redirected to the menu page.
    
Menu Pages (x4):

   - Four pages each containing a restaurant menu.
    
Footer:

   - The footer is identical on all pages.
   - When you click on Contact, a link to an email address is made.
    
Header:

   - The header is present on all pages.
   - The home page caontains the logo of the site.
   - The menu pages contain a button to return to the home page.
    
    
### 2 - Graphic effects and animations ###

The effects accessible by hovering are visible on the model. The must use CSS animations or transitions, no JavaScript or library.

Buttons:

   - When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible.
   - Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually. For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering on dsektop instead os clicking.
    
Home Page:

   - When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this mock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, coverr the whole screen, and use CSS animation (no library). The design is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter.
    
Menu Pages:

   - When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. The may appear either one by one or by group (Starter, Main, Dessert).
   - The visitor can add the dishes he/she wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left. For the first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension points.
